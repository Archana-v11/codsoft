    <p ><h2 style={{ float: 'left' }}>More :</h2><br/><br/>The lion, scientifically known as Panthera leo, is a magnificent and iconic big cat native to Africa.
    It ranks as the second-largest of its kind, with adult males, or lions, weighing between 330 and 550 pounds and sporting distinctive manes around their heads. 
    These majestic creatures are renowned for their social behavior, living in groups called prides, which consist of related females and a few adult males who protect the territory.
     Lions have a tawny coat, excellent vision, and are primarily active during twilight hours.
     They are opportunistic hunters, preying on a variety of animals. 
     Their vocalizations, including the unmistakable roar, resonate across the savannas. 
     Sadly, lions are classified as vulnerable due to threats like habitat loss and poaching.
      Lions hold a significant place in African culture and ecosystems, symbolizing strength, power, and royalty. 
      Lions are often regarded as the kings of the animal kingdom, not only for their physical prowess but also for their symbolic significance.  
      Their broad heads, strong jaws, and powerful bodies make them apex predators in their African habitats.
       Lions are known for their social structure, with prides typically consisting of a few dominant males, a group of related females, and their cubs. 
      The mane, a unique feature of male lions, plays a vital role in protecting them during territorial disputes and intimidating rivals.
